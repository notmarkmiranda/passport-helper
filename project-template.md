### Problem

1-3 sentences describing the problem that you are trying to solve.
* The Denver passport is a great tool to get friends together, but it's difficult to plan an excursion based on where people have and have not been. It is also an extra step to find out if it is worthwhile based on the quality of the venue.

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.
